Welcome to the tutorial of Stacked, where we'll explore the basics of stacked state management in Flutter. In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to use stacked, stacked navigation services, and discuss how and why to use your own services in detail.

We'll build a simple counter application, which will consist of two pages. The counter view will display text from a service, and have two buttons, one for navigating to the home view, and one for incrementing the value of the counter. The home view will simply display the current value of the counter from the service. Along the way, we'll show you how to utilize the stacked architecture to manage state and services across multiple pages, making your code more organized and maintainable.

By the end of this video, you'll have a basic understanding of stacked state management in Flutter, and how to use it in your own projects. So, whether you're new to Flutter, or looking to expand your knowledge, this tutorial is for you.
